## What the heck is this?

This is not your grandma's authentication system. This is the SUPREME, ULTIMATE, BADASS auth kit for **FRIDAY** - the voice-to-text assistant built for vibe coders who are too cool to type with their fingers.

God gave you hands to lift, fingers to... OMG, you got a dirty mind! üß† Fingers are for clicking "Deploy" buttons, not typing like a peasant.

## Features that will blow your mind ü§Ø

- **Google Auth** - Because remembering passwords is for boomers
- **Secret Keys** - So secret that even I don't know what they do
- **Stripe Integration** - Taking your money has never been easier
- **Two Amazing Plans**:
  - **Monthly Plan ($3)** - For commitment-phobes
  - **Lifetime Plan ($10)** - For legends who aren't afraid of long-term relationships

## Wait, seriously, what is FRIDAY?

FRIDAY is your new digital companion, helping you code with the power of your voice because your fingers deserve a break. Those typing marathons? They're over. Now you can just talk to your computer like a normal socially-awkward developer.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` (or just stare at it until it installs itself)
3. Set up your Firebase and Stripe (instructions in those boring .md files)
4. `npm run dev`
5. Talk to your computer
6. Wonder why you're still single
7. Realize it's because you talk to your computer

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - Because React alone isn't complicated enough
- **Firebase** - Google's way of saying "We know everything about you"
- **Stripe** - Money printer go brrrr
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript with a superiority complex

## FAQ

### Is this a joke?
Yes, but it actually works.

### Can I really code with my voice?
Yes, but no one will want to sit next to you at the coffee shop.

### Why is it called "Female Replacement"?
It's not replacing females. It's a female that replaces your need to type. Get your mind out of the gutter!

### How much did it cost to make this?
My dignity and several sleepless nights.

### Will this improve my coding?
Probably not, but it will improve your talking-to-yourself skills.
